# blog.kaet.xyz
This website serves as my personal blog, where I get to post about my interests to no one in particular.
The blog was built using Astro with minimal CSS and JavaScript as I wanted to keep the design as elegant as possible. It is hosted using AWS.
The home page currently displays a list of the most recent blog posts I have written, soon I would like to create a tag index.
