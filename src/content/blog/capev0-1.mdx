## Incompatible techniques ? 

Bit of an issue alreafy with the pattern which is that it's too wide!! 6 stitches to be exact..
But even if I did make it 6 rows narrower, it would be very difficult to knit.

Could try knitting in semi - circular, but I'll have to try and see how that works.
Or could also try knitting is horizontally ?? But that would make it more annoying to knit.
