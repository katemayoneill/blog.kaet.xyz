Wednesday and Thursday this week I attempted to fish for perch in the canal.
I was unsuccessful on both occasions. Actually, I have never caught a fish ever in my life ;\(

On Wednesday, the fishing shop was closed by the time I got off work and I decided to use corn.
When we got to the canal, the friendly canal regulars told me corn is no good, and
that I need to dig for worms. Next day, I bought worms and went back. Still no luck.

A dear friend of mine sent me some potential reasons why I went home empty handed...

1. “Little fishies” ≠ hungry fishies
    - The fish at the canal are very small, and I was nervous about what to do once I caught one.
2. Shallow water = spooked fish
    - They didn't seem bothered about anything to me.
3. Oxygen + temperature = sluggish fish
    - I don't know what this means.
4. Time of day matters
    - We were fishing at dusk.
5. Your worms might've been too chunky
    - I feel sooo bad about killing those worms...

On account of trying my best, and not really wanting to get too involved with the usual suspects, 
I have decided to give up for now.
