## Incompatible techniques

After knitting the first cape, I cna now write the actual pattern for the first version of the cape.

## Pattern v1

### hood

Put 42 needles on either side of needle 0 into working position. Do this on front and back beds (168 needles total).
Move the front bed one translation using racking switch so that the needles on front bed are no longer facing the needles on back bed.

Tension 1 and red keys pressed, pass the cam boxes right to left. Insert the teeth of the mounting comb without the 
steel wire so that the wool passes between the teeth of the mounting comb. Attach the steel wire. 
Move the front bed bed to original position so that front and back bed needles are facing eachother.

We will knit the hood in semi-circular. 

> # Semi circular knitting
> The needle position is the same as for that of circular knitting. The only difference is that an opening is provided for at the side.
> The casting on is similar to the closed or open circular casting on and the knitting is obtained as follows:
>
> Cam boxes to the left.
> - Back cam box, keys cancelled / Front cam box red key. Knit two rows.
> - Back cam box red key / Front cam box, keys cancelled. Knit two rows.
>
> The opening will be to the right.
- *Singer MK1 Manual p.22*

In order to achieve a slip stitch edge, put needle on open side into holding position when knitting the 1st row of front, back passes.
Put needle back into working position before 2nd pass, making sure that working yarn is passed under the last needle.

Knit 144 rounds, counter will read 288.

Switch to waste yarn of contrasting colour. Knit 20 rounds with green keys pressed on front and back cam boxes, remove work from machine.

Pick up 144 stitches along opening edge of hood; 36 needles each side of needle 0 on front and back beds.
Knit 20 rounds in circular, counter reads 40.

Cast off.

### Shoulders

Pick up the last row of main yarn, 168 stitches total; 42 needles each side on front and back beds. 
Start with picking up the 2 stitches at the bottom of the hood opening and placing them on needle 0 of the front bed.

Reset counter to 0, knit 85 rounds. Increase by 4 stitches, one on left and right hand sides on each bed on following rounds: 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 24, 26, 28, 30, 32, 34, 35, 37, 39, 41, 43, 45, 46, 48, 50, 52, 54, 56, 57, 59, 61, 63, 65, 67, 68, 70, 72, 74, 76, 78, 79, 81, 83, 85.

### Body

Cancel keys on back cam box, switch to waster yarn and knit 15 rows on front bed. Drop work off of front bed. 

knit 60 rows.

Switch to 4x4 rib. Knit 12 rows decreasing 2 stitches every other row.

Knit 8 rows, decreasing 4 stitches every other row.

Cast off.

Pick up the stitches that were dropped off the machine and repeat the same steps.
