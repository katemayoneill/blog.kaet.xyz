# The design process

I have been trying to recreate a little cape i bought a from a woman on a footpath 
during my last day in Amsterdam. By trying I mean thinking about making it all the time, but not
really doing anything. It's probably because I don't even know where to start.

Recently I met my friends dad and we spoke about the design process. I thought that it was going to 
be this magical method that would make everything in my life more efficient. 
I read about it tonight and it just seems to be a more human version of scrum software development... 
This was my nightmare in college so i'm reluctant to admit that it is a very efficient method.

## planning

### user stories

This is where you thing *what do i want this to do?*, *what problems is it going to solve?*.

To do this, we use **user stories**, where you roleplay as someone who is going to interact with 
the product and you try and figure out what they need from it.

```kroki type=plantuml
"Wearer" as U
U -> (i want to look really cool, sexy, cute)

"Knitter" as K
K --> (i want to have fun knitting the product)
K ---> (i want to make money by selling the product)
```

### product backlog: groom and refine ðŸ¤¤

Now we just think of tasks that address each user story and break them up into tasks that have a simpler solution.

```kroki type=plantuml
@startmindmap
<style>
node {

    MaximumWidth 100
}

leafNode {
    FontColor blue
    MaximumWidth auto
}

arrow {
    LineStyle 4
    LineThickness 0.5
}
</style>
*_ "i want to look cool sexy cute"
** design flattering and unique cape
*** research cape patterns
**** make pinterest board of capes
**** make ravelry album of patterns
**** find new sources of inspiration
**** list different ways to construct capes
*** make pattern of existing cape
**** trace sample cape onto paper and measure
**** make digital sample cape pattern

*_ "i want to have fun knitting this product again and again"
** write simple pattern using techniques that are compatible with machine
*** research techniques to avoid
**** make list of incompatible techniques
*** make pattern
**** draw digital pattern with measurements
**** make swatches or material at various gauges
**** measure swatch and calculate pattern gauge
**** write pattern

*_ "i want to make money by selling the product"
** knit cape
** note material and labour costs
*** measure amount of wool in each cape
*** note how many hours are put into each cape
** advertise product 
*** document product development publicly
**** publish blog posts
**** write detailed pattern and tutorial
*** take photos and videos of product at every stage of development</color>
** make on online shop

### Agile Methodology
Obviously I won't be happy with the first version so i'll be using a sort of Agile Methodology. 
Each cycle will be a new version of the cape.

```kroki type=plantuml
@startuml
while( happy with end product ? ) is (no)
:plan;
:design;
:develop;
:review;
endwhile (yes);
: deploy; 
@enduml
```

### milestones

split the project into chunks, and give a rough timeline of when each milestone should be accomplished.


v1: 31 August

v2: 30 september

v3: 31 october

v4: 31 November

deploy: 10 december
