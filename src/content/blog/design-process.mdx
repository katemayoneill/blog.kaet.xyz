# The design process

I have been trying to recreate a little cape i bought a from a woman on a footpath 
during my last day in Amsterdam. By trying I mean thinking about making it all the time, but not
really doing anything. It's probably because I don't even know where to start.

Recently I met my friends dad and we spoke about the design process. I thought that it was going to 
be this magical method that would make everything in my life more efficient. 
I read about it tonight and it just seems to be a more human version of scrum software development... 
This was my nightmare in college so i'm reluctant to admit that it is a very efficient method.

## planning

### user stories

This is where you thing *what do i want this to do?*, *what problems is it going to solve?*.

To do this, we use **user stories**, where you roleplay as someone who is going to interact with 
the product and you try and figure out what they need from it.

- as a user, i want to look really cool, sexy, cute.
- as a knitter, i want something that doesn't make me want to give up.
- as a knitter, i want to make money selling the capes.
- as a knitter, i want the product to attract a following
- as a user, I want a versatile garment
- as a knitter, i want to easily procure the required materials

### product backlog

Now we just think of tasks that address each user story.

- Product is flattering on the body
- Pattern uses techniques that are compatible with old fashioned machine.
- Product is worth more that the sum of its parts.
- Product is unlike any trending clothing item or reiteration thereof.
- Product is versatile and wearable.
- Product is made of materials available from local shops.

and maybe add on a few more boring things that i missed

- Product has a detailed pattern
- Product development is well documented

### grooming ?

Let's break every tasks up into more tasks that have a simpler solution.

- Make a pattern of sample cape.
- Take inspiration from old cape patterns.
- Make sample pattern compatible with machine.
- Make sample pattern more flattering.
- Make sample pattern more unique.
- Make pattern be relatively quick to knit.
- Make swatches of material at various tensions.

### refinement

Now we break it down even further into easily quantifiable tasks.

- make measurements of traced pattern
- draw a vector pattern
- research patterns that are similar to desired product
- write a pattern that uses techniques compatible with machine
- prepare swatches of material at various tensions
- takes measurements of swatches and noted stitches/centimeter
- calculate row counts and stitch numbers for pattern
- knit prototype
- document production
...

### milestones

split the project into chunks.

1. research

2. initial pattern 

3. knit first version

4. refine pattern

5. knit final version
